## The Project 

Midthorn Builders is a micro project that explored the combined use of Figma and Astro to design and build a web application. These tools were brand new to me, however I learned a lot about them in this short 2-day exercise.

I used Figma to design a simple 2-page website with common features including a hero section, teaser blocks and a contact form and then settled on a combination of colors and fonts which I liked.

I then transposed this design to the web using the Astro JavaScript framework, with the project files stored in a GitHub repo, and the application deployed to Netlify.

## What I learned

- Figma is very intuitive and has all the positive features of similar applications like Photoshop and Canva.
- I found it much easier to find certain tools and create objects when compared to Photoshop.
- The frames tool for creating artboards for specific device sizes was extremely useful.
- Extracting all the fonts and colors from the design allowed me to define them in the global CSS file at the start of the project.
- I saved so much time over designing a site on the fly.
- Astroâ€™s folder structure is very intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Local styles and scripts meant I could make more elements into components and not have to worry so much about class names and scope.
- I had to be careful with local scripts trying to access elements that were not yet rendered in the DOM however.
- Making large hero images play nicely on window resizes is tough.
- I need to use box-shadows for offset backgrounds instead of margins and transforms.
- Design for mobile first next time!
